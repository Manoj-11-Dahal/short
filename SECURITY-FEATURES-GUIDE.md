# Portfolio Website Security Features Guide

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the security features implemented in the portfolio website. These features are designed to protect against common web vulnerabilities and ensure the security of user data and administrative functions.

## 1. Enhanced Auth0 Integration

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

The Auth0 integration has been enhanced with proper role-based access control:

- **Role Definitions**: Clear separation between admin, user, and guest roles
- **Server-Side Verification**: All protected operations verify user roles on the server side
- **JWT Token Validation**: Enhanced validation including algorithm verification, expiration checks, and scope validation

### Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

- **Admin Requirement**: 2FA is enforced for all admin users
- **MFA Verification**: JWT tokens are checked for MFA completion for sensitive operations
- **Recovery Options**: Secure recovery paths for lost 2FA devices

### Secure Password Policies

- **Strength Requirements**: Passwords must meet minimum complexity requirements
- **Expiration Policies**: Admin passwords expire after 90 days
- **Brute Force Protection**: Account lockouts after multiple failed attempts

## 2. Input Validation & Sanitization

All user inputs are validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks:

- **Server-Side Validation**: All inputs are validated on the server regardless of client-side validation
- **Type Checking**: Inputs are checked for correct data types
- **Sanitization**: All user inputs are sanitized before use in database queries or HTML output

## 3. CSRF Protection

Cross-Site Request Forgery protection has been implemented:

- **Token Generation**: Secure random tokens are generated for each session
- **Token Validation**: All state-changing operations require valid CSRF tokens
- **Cookie Attributes**: SameSite and Secure attributes are set on cookies

## 4. Database Security

- **Prepared Statements**: All database queries use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection
- **Connection Pooling**: Efficient and secure database connections
- **Data Encryption**: Sensitive data is encrypted at rest
- **Least Privilege**: Database users have only the permissions they need

## 5. API Security

- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse by limiting request frequency
- **JWT Validation**: Comprehensive token validation for all API requests
- **CORS Configuration**: Proper Cross-Origin Resource Sharing settings
- **Input Validation**: All API inputs are validated and sanitized

## 6. Error Handling & Logging

- **Custom Error Handlers**: Prevent information disclosure in error messages
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Security events are logged for audit purposes
- **Suspicious Activity Alerts**: Unusual patterns trigger alerts
- **Production Mode**: Debug information is disabled in production

## 7. HTTP Security Headers

The following security headers are implemented:

- **Content-Security-Policy (CSP)**: Controls which resources can be loaded
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: Prevents MIME type sniffing
- **X-Frame-Options**: Prevents clickjacking attacks
- **Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)**: Enforces HTTPS connections
- **Referrer-Policy**: Controls information in the Referer header

## Implementation Files

- `security.php`: Core security implementation with classes for each security feature
- `auth.php`: Enhanced Auth0 integration with improved JWT validation
- All API endpoints: Updated with input validation, CSRF protection, and rate limiting

## Security Best Practices for Developers

1. **Always validate user input** on the server side, even if client-side validation exists
2. **Never trust client-side data** or validation
3. **Use prepared statements** for all database queries
4. **Implement proper error handling** that doesn't expose sensitive information
5. **Keep dependencies updated** to patch security vulnerabilities
6. **Follow the principle of least privilege** when assigning permissions
7. **Implement proper logging** for security events and suspicious activities
8. **Use HTTPS** for all communications
9. **Implement proper authentication and authorization** for all protected resources
10. **Regularly review and update security measures** as new threats emerge

## Security Monitoring and Maintenance

- Regular security audits should be conducted
- Dependencies should be kept updated to patch vulnerabilities
- Security logs should be monitored for suspicious activities
- Security policies should be reviewed and updated regularly
